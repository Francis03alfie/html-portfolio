<h1>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Here are the best movies I've seen so far</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Top 1: Maze Runner</h3>
<p>I am so amazed with the plot of this movie. <br>
    I love everything about this movie<br>
</p>
<h3>Top 2: Parasite</h3>
<p> The conflict of this movie that talks about the difference of the rich and the poor is so good<br>
I also love the open ending of this movie that tells the viewers that it can be followed by part 2<br>
</p>
<h3>Top 3: The 100</h3>
<p>Before you say anything else, yes this is not a movie but a series. I just couln't think of any movie that I can call my favorite at the moment so it is what it is<nr>
</br>
Anyway, this is really a good series and I hope more people get to watch this masterpiece.<br>
